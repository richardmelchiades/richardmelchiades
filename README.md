- 👋 Hi, I’m @richardmelchiades
- 👀 I’m interested in graphic and motion design, lettering, calligraphy, visual art, movies, books, songs and chess.
- 🌱 I'm Brazilian but I've lived in Belgium and I'm currently living in Spain. I speak native Portuguese, intermediate English, beginning French and I am learning to speak Spanish.
- 📚 I decided to learn a lot of new things in 2023 like other languages, tattoos and now, Python programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mainly on personal projects like urban art (street art, graffitti etc) or motion and programing projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: linktr.ee/richard.melchiades
